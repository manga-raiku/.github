## Hi there 👋

`Manga Raiku` is a `sibling` organization with [Anime Vsub](https://github.com/anime-vsub) whose mission is to make manga (mainly) and some other types of stories more accessible to everyone.

The organization is currently hosting the app of the same name (which is a more advanced version of [Tachiyomi](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/)) which is a free and ad-free cross-platform story-reading app.

> The app will be available soon and the source code will be public

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
